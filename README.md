## üîç Project Motivation

This project was built to deepen my understanding of full-stack development using the **MERN stack**, and to gain experience integrating third-party services like **Stripe** for payments and Firebase/Auth0 for authentication. It helped me improve at building **responsive UIs**, managing **backend logic**, and architecting **real-world workflows** such as order placement, payment handling, and status tracking.
